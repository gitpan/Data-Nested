Data::ALoNE (never released to CPAN)
====================================

Version 1.00  2007-08-31
   Initial release

Version 1.01  2008-01-24
   Added _ae so that the AEs are actually calculated and stored (a
      significant number of the guts routines were rewritten to
      take advantage of this)
   Significant reorg/rewrite of the guts to clean it up
   Updated test.pl

At this point, Data::ALoNE was renamed and split into Data::NDS and
Data::Multisource.

Data::NDS and Data::NDS::Multisource
====================================

Data::NDS  Version 1.00   2008-02-27
   Initial release

Data::NDS  Version 1.01   2008-05-05
   Fixed bug where merge ignored the $new=1 arg. Ashley Hindmarsh
   Added identical and contains methods
   keys and values now only return non-empty elements
   Added value method
   Added default and override rulesets
   Added ruleset_valid method
   Added which method
   Added lots of examples to manual
   Added Build.PL and several other things to meet requirements on
      http://cpants.perl.org/

Data::NDS::Multisource  Version 2.00  2008-05-05
   Updated test.pl
   Abstracted some of the routines into the newly created Data::NDS
      module (complete rewrite to account for this)
   Renamed to Data::NDS::Multisource
   Added Build.PL and several other things to meet requirements on
      http://cpants.perl.org/

Data::NDS  Version 1.02  2008-05-08
   Additional changes to meet requirements on http://cpants.perl.org/
   Speedups.

Data::NDS  Version 1.03  2008-05-09
   Final changes to meet requirements on http://cpants.perl.org/
   Bug fix so it won't fail with "Too early to specify a build action"

Data::NDS  Version 1.04  2008-06-12
   Added check_value method
   Added print method
   Added "keys" to get_structure functionality
   Explicitly defined each method as working with the actual structure,
     or with a copy of the structure.

Data::NDS::Multisource  Version 2.01  2008-06-12
   Additional changes to meet requirements on http://cpants.perl.org/
   Much faster
   Better handling of defaults

Data::NDS  Version 1.05  2008-06-19
   Fixed a bug in merging

Data::NDS::Multisource  Version 2.02  2008-06-19
   Added support for erasing paths to update_ele

At this point, I realized that Data::NDS::Multisource was complicated
enough that I chose not to use all of the functionality. I extracted
the functionality I DID use and created Data::NDS::Multiele and
Data::NDS::Multifile and deprecated Data::NDS::Multisource.

Data::NDS, Data::NDS::Multiele, and Data::NDS::Multifile
========================================================

Data::NDS  Version 3.00  2009-03-02
   NOTE: jumped versions to synchronize Data::NDS modules
   Backwards incompatible rethink of the module.
   Almost all functions have changed slightly (different error codes,
      different return values).

Data::NDS::Multiele  Version 3.00  2009-03-02
   Complete rewrite.
   Released as Data::NDS::Multiele.

Data::NDS::Multifile  Version 3.00  2009-03-02
   Initial release. Most of the functionality comes from the
      Data::NDS::Multisource module.

Data::NDS  Version 3.10  2009-04-14
   Some docs imporovments prompted by Michael
   Added test_conditions method (previously an internal only part of
      the Multiele module).

Data::NDS::Multiele  Version 3.10  2009-04-14
   Cleaned up some of the internals.
   Moved test_conditions to Data::NDS module (for use with other
      Data::NDS::* modules)
   Added raw option to value, keys, values.

Data::NDS::Multifile  Version 3.10  2009-04-14
   Cleaned up some of the internals.

Data::NDS::Multiele  Version 3.11  2010-02-05
   Added "no new structure" option to the file method.
   Fixed a couple bugs.
   Added path_in_use method.
   Performance improvements.

Data::NDS  Version 3.11  2010-02-25
   Renamed the module to Data::Nested .  3.11 is the final version of
      Data::NDS .

Data::NDS::Multifile  Version 3.11  2010-02-05
   Added path_in_use method.
   Minor bug fix in path_values.

Data::NDS::Multiele  Version 3.12  2010-03-04
   Fixed "use Data::NDS" to require the correct version.
   Renamed the module to Data::Nested::Multiele and added to the
      Data::Nested distribution .  3.12 is the final release of
      Data::NDS::Multiele .

Data::NDS::Multifile  Version 3.12  2010-03-04
   Fixed "use Data::NDS::Multiele" to require the correct version.
   Renamed the module to Data::Nested::Multifile and added to the
      Data::Nested distribution .  3.12 is the final release of
      Data::NDS::Multifile .

Data::Nested
============

Version 3.11  2010-02-25
   Renamed the module Data::NDS to Data::Nested .  3.11 is the final
      version of Data::NDS and the first version of Data::Nested .

Version 3.12  2010-03-04
   Added Data::Nested::Multiele and Data::Nested::Multifile.

# BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES
########################################################################

Version 3.00
   *** NOTE ***
   Version 3.00 is a complete rethink/rewrite of the modules. Based on
   real-life use of the module, a number of changes were made to
   make the module easier to use and more consistent internally.

Version 3.10
   The API of the 3.10 series is backward compatible with 3.00, but
   due to changes in the internals, the 3.10 Data::NDS module is
   required for the 3.10 version of other Data::NDS::* modules.

Version 3.11/3.12
   Renamed the module at the suggestion of the perl module list
   maintainers.
